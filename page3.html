		<div class="box1">The Women's soccer team has played more games than the men's team- and win more of them - but still recieve less pay than them. Institutionalized gender discrimination affects their paychecks, where they play and how often,medical care and coaching they recieved, and how they are able to travel to matches. </div>
		<div class="box2">In 1967, women weren't allowed to enter the Boston Marathon, so Katherine Switzer entered hiding what gender she was. Katherine Switzer couldn't finish the race because Jock Semple told her to get out of the race attempting to pull off her number during the race.</div>
		<div class="box3">Billie Jean King led a movement for female players to earn equal prize money in tennis tournaments that featured of both sexes. She epitomized her crusade gender equality after beating Bobby Rigs in the battle of the sexes.</div>
		<div class="box4">The WNBA salary was $117,500 last season compared with $37.4 million in the NBA. Wilson from WNBA earned about $53,000 that season when Desandre Ayton was going to earn $6.8 million in his first year for playing for the Phoenix Suns.</div>
		<div class="box5">The conventional wisdom is that baseball is for boys and men, and softball is for girls and women. " Officials claimed that baseball was “a contact sport”; that boys would quit if girls were allowed; that girls’ bones were weaker than boys’; that facial injuries could ruin a girl’s looks and therefore prospects in life; and, most outlandishly, that girls struck in the chest by a ball might later develop breast cancer." This is why major league baseball thought it would be best to have girls not play baseball. </div>
